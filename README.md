#Mouseless challenge:

In the same way that a musician's instrument is often referred to as an extension of their body, a programmer's computer should extend the programmer. Speed, comfort and your ability to manipulate your machine are all things that are key for successful programmers. This exercise is intended to make you feel more comfortable using your keyboard and relying less on your mouse. Follow the steps below. Hints are provided to help you if you get stuck. The challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to complete this entire exercise WITHOUT using the mouse.

1. Open terminal and navigate to a desired location. 
2. Make a new directory called mouseless. 
3. Go into the directory. 
4. Create a new file called index.html 
5. Create another file called style.css
6. Open all files in Sublime 
7. Create basic HTML blueprint. Do this by only hitting three keys maximum.
8. Open the file in your browser. DON'T USE YOUR MOUSE. Can you think of another way?
9. Open a new TAB in your browser and search for sublime text shortcuts.
10. Without using your mouse go back to your index.html file.
11. Open a new WINDOW in your browser.
12. Go back to your index.html file.
13. Add an unordered list inside your <body> tags.
14. Add five list items with the text "My favorite colors is " . Note: The grammatical error is intentional. Also note, is the most efficient way of doing this to type it out five times? Can you think of a better way?
15. Let's fix our grammar. Remove the extra "s" in colors". Can we do these all at once?
16. Save the file
17. Let's go back to Chrome.
18. Go to the Google search result you had open and close the window. Note: close the window only, not the entire program.
19. Go back to sublime and add a class called taco to the unordered list items.
20. Add an id for each line item. Call it the same as you will each color. What's the most efficient way of doing this? 
21. Make the screen a full screen - NO MOUSE!!!
22. Create an ordered list inside your body tag but outside your ul
23. Create 10 list items and call them "That's my song "
24. Let's change the word "song" to "jam" on all ordered lists.
25. Let's make all instances of the word "jam" into capital letters.
26. Let's comment out the last list item
